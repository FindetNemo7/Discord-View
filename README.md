# Discord-View
In this GitHub repository you can find a Discord bot that allows members to view an embed with information about a specific user using the "**/view** [username]" command. The embed is only visible to the sender of the command.

# how to install it

In this GitHub repository you can find a Discord bot specifically designed for use on replit.

In order to use the bot, you must first create a Discord bot and invite it to your Discord.. You can do this on the website https://discord.com/developers/applications.
You will receive a bot token that you need to run the bot on https://replit.com/. To ensure that the token remains private and that nobody gains unauthorized access to your bot, you should store the token in a secret on the replit page.

The **"webserver.py"** file was added to keep the bot permanently online. This file ensures that the bot runs on a web server instance. The web server URL consists of https://projectname.username.repl.co, where "projectname" and "username" should be replaced with your own data. You must put this URL on the https://uptimerobot.com/ page so that the bot is pinged every 5 minutes. UptimeRobot is a free tool that ensures your bot stays online all the time.

You are now good to go and start the Replit repository! All required libraries will be installed automatically.
We recommend that you grant admin rights to the bot so that it can run all functions properly.

We hope this information is helpful and we're happy to help if you have any questions or problems!
